## Test Investment Strategies with English-Like Code

PortfolioTesteR is an R package designed for students and individual investors to test investment strategies using clear, readable code. Unlike complex quantitative libraries, PortfolioTesteR uses intuitive function names that read like plain English, making strategy development accessible to everyone.

## Why PortfolioTesteR?

- **English-like syntax**: Functions like `filter_top_n()`, `weight_equally()`, and `run_backtest()` are self-explanatory
- **Educational focus**: Perfect for learning quantitative investing without getting lost in code complexity  
- **Comprehensive toolkit**: 70+ functions covering everything from technical indicators to risk analysis
- **Fast backtesting**: Optimized for testing strategies on large stock universes
- **Ready-to-use data**: Includes sample price data to start testing immediately
- **Realistic results**: Handles warmup periods, transaction tracking, and proper return calculations

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alb3rtazzo/PortfolioTesteR")
```

## Quick Start Example

```r
library(PortfolioTesteR)

# Load sample data
data(sample_prices_weekly)

# Calculate 12-week momentum
momentum <- calc_momentum(sample_prices_weekly, lookback = 12)

# Select top 10 momentum stocks
top_momentum <- filter_top_n(momentum, n = 10)

# Weight selected stocks equally
weights <- weight_equally(top_momentum)

# Run backtest
result <- run_backtest(
  prices = sample_prices_weekly,
  weights = weights,
  initial_capital = 100000,
  name = "Simple Momentum"
)

# View results
print(result)
summary(result)
plot(result)
```

## Sample Data Included

The package includes three datasets for immediate testing:
- `sample_prices_weekly` - Weekly prices for 20 stocks (2017-2020)
- `sample_prices_daily` - Daily prices for detailed analysis
- `sample_sp500_sectors` - Sector classifications

Load them with:
```r
data(sample_prices_weekly)
data(sample_prices_daily)
data(sample_sp500_sectors)
```

## Documentation

Every function includes detailed documentation with examples:

```r
?run_backtest
?calc_momentum
?filter_top_n
```
