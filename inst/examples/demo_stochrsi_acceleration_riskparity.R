# Demo: StochRSI Acceleration + Inverse-Vol Risk Parity
# ------------------------------------------------------
# What this demonstrates
# - Momentum-of-momentum via StochRSI "acceleration" (StochRSI vs its MA)
# - Selection uses a high-StochRSI gate + top-N by acceleration
# - Allocation by inverse-volatility risk parity using DAILY prices
# - Backtest on the weekly grid (bundled datasets only; runs fast)
