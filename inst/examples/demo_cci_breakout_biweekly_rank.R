# Demo: CCI Breakout with Bi-Weekly Cadence + Rank Weights
# --------------------------------------------------------
# What this demonstrates
# - Breakout filter using CCI > +100 on weekly prices
# - From breakers, select top-10 by CCI; weight by rank (exponential)
# - Bi-weekly RE-TUNING of weights; carry forward to weekly dates
# - Backtest on weekly grid (bundled datasets; fast)
