# Demo: Quality-Momentum + Inverse-Vol Risk Parity with Mild Regime
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# - Quality: RSI in [40, 60] band
# - Selection: from qualified names, pick top-12 momentum; cap to 10 positions
# - Allocation: inverse-volatility risk parity (DAILY prices)
# - Regime: SPY above 20W MA = risk-on; else keep 30% exposure (partial)
# - Backtest on weekly grid; no external I/O
