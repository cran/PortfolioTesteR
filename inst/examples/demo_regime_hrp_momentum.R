# Demo: Regime-Filtered Momentum with HRP Allocation (weekly IS, daily risk)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What it shows
# - SPY trend regime (above/below 20-week MA) gating
# - Cross-sectional momentum selection on the weekly grid
# - HRP (Hierarchical Risk Parity) allocation using DAILY prices
# - Backtest on the weekly grid (no external data; runs in seconds)
